# CCG-Stockpyle
The purpose of this application is to manage and keep track of my collectible card game (MTG) collection. 
# Author: Jason Smith
# April 20 2025: Came up with idea and took the following notes:

# Phase 1 - Logic
# Enter name of card or add new card
# Get number in collection
# Get info about the card if in collection
# - At least an image of the card for now
# If none, give option of adding card
# If >1, choices of adding or editing current quantity in collection
# Show entire list, quantity, and total number

# Phase 2 - GUI
# Phase 3 - Add more features 



#TODO:
# ~~Change the collection from list to dict {card name, card quantity}~~
# Implement - Remove card methods
# Instead of having to type add everytime, implement loop and enter done/back/exit to go back or quit
# Implement - Save collection(s) Implement - Open and modify existing collection files
# Implement - being able to increase and decrease quantity of a card


# Needs to create a card every time
# - Take input and pass input to card obj
# - The card obj will keep track of their own info
