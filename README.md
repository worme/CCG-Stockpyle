# CCG-Stockpyle
The purpose of this application is to manage and keep track of my collectible card game (MTG) collection. 
# Author: Jason Smith
# April 20 2025: Came up with idea and took the following notes:

# Phase 1 - Logic
# Enter name of card or add new card
# Get number in collection
# Get info about the card if in collection
# - At least an image of the card for now
# If none, give option of adding card
# If >1, choices of adding or editing current quantity in collection
# Show entire list, quantity, and total number

# Phase 2 - GUI
# Phase 3 - Add more features
